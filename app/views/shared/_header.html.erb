<blockquote>"In nature, all is useful, all is beautiful. It is therefore beautiful, because it is alive, moving, reproductive; it is therefore useful, because it is symmetrical and fair.... Beauty will come, as always, unannounced, and spring up between the feet of brave and earnest men." -Ralph Waldo Emerson</blockquote>

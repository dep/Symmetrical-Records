      <p>dep is the solo project of "bedroom producer" Danny Peck. His
      compositions are a hybrid somehwere between film score and electronica --
      with digital/analogue sounds, lush instrumentations and field recordings
      wrapped up in to melodic explorations in electronica.</p>
      <p>Danny Peck has been releasing music under the alias "dep" since
      roughly 2005, but has maintained a keen interest in song-writing and

      <p>
        Hailing from Lincoln, Britain is producer and composer Ben Steed. We've
        been a huge fan of Ben's gently textured and inspired compositions for
        several years now, so obviously we were very excited when he chose to join
        the Symmetrical Records family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ben Steed produces richly textured, thoughtful ambient/electronica for the
        discerning listener.  His aesthetic has a quality to it that is rarely seen,
        and must be heard again and again.

      <p>
        Brazil's Gimu has an impressive ambient range that must be heard to be believed. His drone/ambient
        compositions keep us coming back for more and has become our go-to rainy day
        music backdrop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enjoy the gentle evolution in Gimu's soundscapes as he takes you on a journey
        that you wont want to come back from. If you have a quality pair of headphones,
        he's definitely someone worth pulling them out for.

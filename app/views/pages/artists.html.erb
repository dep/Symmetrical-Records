      Kie Cochran and Danny Peck came together in March of 2011 and, after experiencing what they called "instant flow" during their first jam session, immediately began producing their first EP.  The songs are generally a combination of Danny's sequenced beats, keys, vocals, and manipulations of other analog gadgetry, in equal parts with Kie's sweeping fx-driven guitar, electric bass, and airy vocals. Kie also regularly offers up his own musical ideas that the two build upon together, sculpting in to a finished product.</p>
